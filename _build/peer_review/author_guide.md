# Guide for Authors

## Code Style

pyOpenSci encourages authors to consult [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for information on how to style your code.

## Packaging Guide

The [first section of this guidebook](../packaging/packaging_guide) has info for creating and packaging your Python project for review and release. The guide also includes info on the basic requirements for pyOpenSci: testing, continuous integration, documentation, etc.

We also have a [section](../maintenance/release) about releasing your package on PyPI, but we encourage you to wait until after the pyOpenSci review process has finished before uploading to PyPI. This makes it easier to incorporate changes/suggestions from the reviews.

PyPI also has a [short tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) on how to package a Python project for easy installation.  

## Presubmission 
If you are unsure if your package fits within pyOpenSci's [scope](aims_scope), you're encouraged to open a presubmission inquiry issue on the [software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repository.

## Submission for Peer Review
To request peer review, start a new issue in the [pyOpenSci/software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repository and fill out the "Submit Software for Review" issue template. For more information on the process and timeline for review, see our [section on the review process](peer_review_proc).
