# The pyOpenSci Dev Guide

This is the development guide for pyOpenSci!

## Why pyOpenSci?
pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through peer-review of scientific Python packages. We also build technical capacity by providing a curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community among scientific Python users so that we can help each other become better programmers and researchers.

## This Guide
This guidebook contains information for pyOpenSci package authors, reviewers, and editors. It is organized into three sections:

### 1. Before Review - Packaging Guide
Contains our guidelines for creating and testing scientific python packages. Before submitting a package for review, check to be sure that your software meets the basic [requirements](packaging/packaging_guide#overview). The section also contains recommendations and best practices that might be helpful as you are writing and preparing your pakcage.

### 2. Peer Review Process
Outlines the pyOpenSci peer review process. This includes guidelines for submitting and reviewing packages, as well as our [Code of Conduct](peer_review/coc). The [Aims and Scope](peer_review/aims_scope) section lays out what types of packages we are able to review. If you are unsure whether your package fits, we encourage you to submit a [presubmission inquiry](peer_review/author_guide#presubmission)

### 3. After Review - Maintenance
Provides tips and advice for maintaining and promoting your pyOpenSci package after the review process has finished.

## Improving this Guide
