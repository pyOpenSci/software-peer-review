## Editor in Chief checks

Hi there! Thank you for submitting your package for pyOpenSci
review. Below are the basic checks that your package needs to pass
to begin our review. If some of these are missing, we will ask you
to work on them before the review process begins.

Please check our [Python packaging guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide) for more information on the elements
below.

- [ ] **Installation** The package can be installed from a community repository such as PyPI (preferred), and/or a community channel on conda (e.g. conda-forge, bioconda).
  - [ ] The package imports properly into a standard Python environment `import package-name`.
- [ ] **Fit** The package meets criteria for [fit](https://www.pyopensci.org/peer-review-guide/about/package-scope.html) and [overlap](https://www/pyopensci.org/peer-review-guide/about/package-scope.html#package-overlap).
- [ ] **Documentation** The package has sufficient online documentation to allow us to evaluate package function and scope *without installing the package*. This includes:
  - [ ] User-facing documentation that overviews how to install and start using the package.
  - [ ] Short tutorials that help a user understand how to use the package and what it can do for them.
  - [ ] API documentation (documentation for your code's functions, classes, methods and attributes): this includes clearly written docstrings with variables defined using a standard docstring format. *We suggest using the [Numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) docstring format*.
- [ ] Core GitHub repository Files
  - [ ] **README** The package has a `README.md` file with clear explanation of what the package does, instructions on how to install it, and a link to development instructions.
  - [ ] **Contributing File** The package has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that details how to install and contribute to the package.
  - [ ] **Code of Conduct** The package has a `Code of Conduct` file.
  - [ ] **License** The package has an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
NOTE: We prefer that you have development instructions in your documentation too.
- [ ] **Issue Submission Documentation** All of the information is filled out in the `YAML` header of the issue (located at the top of the issue template).
- [ ] **Automated tests** Package has a testing suite and is tested via GitHub actions or another Continuous Integration service.
- [ ] **Repository** The repository link resolves correctly.
- [ ] **Package overlap** The package doesn't entirely overlap with the functionality of other packages that have already been submitted to pyOpenSci.
- [ ] **Archive** (JOSS only, may be post-review): The repository DOI resolves correctly.
- [ ] **Version** (JOSS only, may be post-review): Does the release version given match the GitHub release (v1.0.0)?

- [ ] [Initial onboarding survey was filled out ](https://forms.gle/F9mou7S3jhe8DMJ16)
We appreciate each maintainer of the package filling out this survey individually. :raised_hands:
Thank you authors in advance for setting aside five to ten minutes to do this. It truly helps our organization. :raised_hands:
