## Editor in Chief checks

Hi there! Thank you for submitting your package for pyOpenSci
review. Below are the basic checks that your package needs to pass
to begin our review. If some of these are missing, we will ask you
to work on them before the review process begins.

Please check our [Python packaging guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide) for more information on the elements
below.

- [ ] **Installation** The package can be installed from a community repository such as PyPI (preferred), and/or a community channel on conda (for example, conda-forge, bioconda).
  - [ ] The package imports properly into a standard Python environment `import package`.
- [ ] **Fit** The package meets criteria for [fit](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/about/package-scope.html#what-types-of-packages-does-pyopensci-review) and [overlap](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/about/package-scope.html#package-overlap).
- [ ] **Documentation** The package has sufficient online documentation to allow us to evaluate the package's function and scope *without installing the package*. This includes:
  - [ ] User-facing documentation that overviews how to install and start using the package.
  - [ ] Short, quickstart tutorials that help a user understand how to use the package and what it can do for them.
  - [ ] API documentation (documentation for your code's functions, classes, methods, and attributes): this includes clearly written docstrings with variables defined using a standard docstring format.
- [ ] Core GitHub repository Files
  - [ ] **README** The package has a `README.md` file with a clear explanation of what the package does, instructions on how to install it, and a link to development instructions.
  - [ ] **Contributing File** The package has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that details how to install and contribute to the package.
  - [ ] **Code of Conduct** The package has a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file.
  - [ ] **License** The package has an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
NOTE: We prefer that you have development instructions in your documentation too.
- [ ] **Issue Submission Documentation** All of the information is filled out in the `YAML` header of the issue (located at the top of the issue template).
- [ ] **Automated tests** Package has a testing suite and is tested via a Continuous Integration service.
- [ ] **Repository** The repository link resolves correctly.
- [ ] **Package overlap** The package doesn't entirely overlap with the functionality of other packages that have already been submitted to pyOpenSci.
- [ ] **Archive** (JOSS only, may be post-review): The repository DOI resolves correctly.
- [ ] **Version** (JOSS only, may be post-review): Does the release version given match the GitHub release (v1.0.0)?
- [ ] The package authors have disclosed the use of Generative AI tools in the development and/or maintenance of their package.

**Optional but recommended:**

- [ ] **Linting** The package uses automated linting (e.g., [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)) to enforce code style and quality standards, ideally integrated with CI.
- [ ] **Type checking** The package includes type hints and uses a type checker (e.g., [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/)) to catch type-related issues, ideally integrated with CI.
- [ ] **Modern tooling** The package uses modern Python development tools (e.g., [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management) and [Hatch](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/python-package-build-tools.html#about-hatch) for building publishing and running development tasks to streamline development workflows. See the pyOpenSci packaging guide for more on [modern packaging tools](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/python-package-build-tools.html).

**Optional:** Let projects know that it's a great idea for projects to have a .github repository for the project organization where they can host a commonly used LICENSE, Code of Conduct, and even a YAML file with label definitions. These items will then be automatically applied to every repository in the organization to ensure consistency (but can be customized within repos too). The [SunPy project](https://github.com/sunpy/.github/) has a great example of this.

- [ ] [Initial onboarding survey was filled out ](https://forms.gle/F9mou7S3jhe8DMJ16)
We appreciate each maintainer of the package filling out this survey individually. :raised_hands:
A big thank you in advance to authors for setting aside five to ten minutes to do this. It truly helps our organization! :raised_hands:
