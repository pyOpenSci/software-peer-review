- [ ] Generative AI was used to produce some of the material in this submission.
- [ ] If generative AI was used in this project, the authors affirm that all generated material has been reviewed and edited for clarity, correctness, and completeness. The authors are responsible for the content of their work and affirm that it is in a state where reviewers will not be responsible for primary editing and review of machine-generated material.

If you checked the first box above, please describe how generative AI was used, including:

- **Which parts** of the submission were generated (e.g., documentation, tests, code). In addition to a general description, please specifically indicate any substantial portions of code (classes, modules, subpackages) that were wholly or primarily generated by AI.
- **The approximate scale** of the generated portions (e.g., "all of the tests were generated and then checked by a human," "small routines were generated and copied into the code").
- **How the generative AI was used** (e.g., line completion, help with translation, queried separately and integrated, agentic workflow).
