# Get Involved with PyOpenSci

Welcome to PyOpenSci submissions. Below, you will find a collection of guides
that will direct you through the peer review process.

* **[Authors Guide](author-guide):** If you are a **package maintainer** who is
interested in submitting a package to
pyOpenSci, check out the authors guide.
* **[Reviewers guide](reviewer-guide):** If you have volunteered to be a
**reviewer** for a pyOpenSci package, you will want to carefully read
through the reviewer guide for guidance on how we run our reviews. Thank you in
advance for volunteering your time to support open science and open source software!
* **[Editor guide](editors-guide):** Editors for pyOpenSci have previous
experience reviewing packages for pyOpenSci. The editor guide
will walk you through the best practices for the editor role.
* **[Editor in Chief guide](editor-in-chief-guide):** The Editor in Chief will
eventually be a rotating position within pyOpenSci held by members of the
pyOpenSci editorial board (once this is created).
