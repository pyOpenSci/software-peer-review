# How pyOpenSci's open software peer review works


## Who submits packages and who runs the reviews 

pyOpenSci's [suite of packages](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages/) are 
contributed by community members with a great diversity of skills and backgrounds. This diversity 
of developer backgrounds enables us to vet and promote a broad ecosystem of 
high quality tools 
that supports scientists across domains with a suite of different data 
types and structures. 

### Who reviews pyOpenSci packages ?

Our peer review process is run by volunteer members of the Python scientific 
community:

* Editors manage incoming package submissions. Editors also ensure 
that package reviews move through the review process efficiently; 
* Authors create, submit and improve their package; 
* Reviewers, two per submission, examine the software code and user experience. 

Our [governance documentation](https://www.pyopensci.org/governance) clarifies 
the various roles that support running our peer review process. 

## Software reviews are contained within [GitHub](https://www.github.com/pyOpenSci) issues

Our entire peer review process occurs on GitHub in the 
[pyOpenSci software-review repository](https://www.github.com/pyopensci/software-review). 

We use GitHub because:

* It is free to create an account
* Anyone can read the review discussion without an account making the process entirely open
* It facilitates collaboration and supports community around a package
* It facilitates open discussion between reviewers and package maintainers and the pyOpenSci volunteers
* Numerous packages store their code bases on GitHub

### We use GitHub issue templates and labels to organize the review steps

* We use GitHub issue templates as submission templates for new reviews and pre-submission review questions.
* We label issues to track every step of the package submission and review progress (e.g. [1/initial-editor-checks, 2/reviewers-needed, 6/pyopensci-approved](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/labels)
