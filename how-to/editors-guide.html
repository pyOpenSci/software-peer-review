<h1>pyOpenSci Software Review Editor Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#pyopensci-software-review-editor-guide" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Thank you for your time in serving as an editor for a pyOpenSci package! Below, you will find some
information about the role that editors have in the
pyOpenSci Python open peer review process.</p>
<section id="experience-needed-to-become-an-editor">
<h2>Experience needed to become an editor<a class="headerlink" href="#experience-needed-to-become-an-editor" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Editors generally should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have completed a review for <em>at least</em> 1 package for pyOpenSci.</p></li>
<li><p>Have some experience with open-source software that supports the scientific
Python community. This experience could be maintaining or contributing to packages. It could also be experience related to usability of open-source software and/or documentation, tutorials, etc. Alternatively, it could involve participation in the broader scientific Python community in another capacity.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="two-types-of-editors">
<h2>Two types of editors<a class="headerlink" href="#two-types-of-editors" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two types of editors involved in our open peer review process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Guest editors and</p></li>
<li><p>Full editors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of editors are considered a part of the editorial board for
pyOpenSci. The significant differences between guest and full editors are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A guest editor may only join the board for a single review.</p></li>
<li><p>A guest editor may be new to pyOpenSci’s review process and thus require a bit more support in their first review.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="guest-editors">
<h3>Guest editors<a class="headerlink" href="#guest-editors" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A guest editor is invited to lead a review in the
case where we need specific expertise for a single review. We also consider editors who are
performing their first review as guest editors, as they may require more
guidance or mentorship to complete the review (if they are new to our organization).</p>
<p>New editors who wish to continue as full editors for pyOpenSci may do so
as long as both parties (pyOpenSci and the guest editors) feel like it is a
healthy fit for them and the organization.</p>
</section>
<section id="full-editors">
<h3>“Full” editors<a class="headerlink" href="#full-editors" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A full editor is most often someone who has experience with the
pyOpenSci open package review process. A full editor ideally:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>has completed a review for <em>at least</em> 1 package for pyOpenSci</p></li>
<li><p>and/or has submitted and gone through the pyOpenSci package review process</p></li>
<li><p>and/or has experience reviewing for an organization such as JOSS or rOpenSci.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We also appreciate when editors have experience working with or in the
Python open source software community, be it maintaining packages, contributing to
packages, or supporting the community. This is
not a requirement, however if you are interested in getting involved with
pyOpenSci!</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There could be certain situations when an editor is onboarded with less experience! The above are simply guidelines that we like to follow.</p>
</div>

<section id="what-does-an-editor-do-responsibilities">
<h2>What does an editor do? (Responsibilities)<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-an-editor-do-responsibilities" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>An editor is usually recruited by the Editor in Chief, other editors on the
board, or the software review lead. <a class="reference internal" href="onboarding-guide.html"><span class="std std-doc">More on recruiting editors can be found here</span></a>.</p>
<p>An editor is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>Ideally, an editor can commit to serving for <strong>at least</strong> one year as an editor
for pyOpenSci. During that year, we expect that you will lead the review of 3-4 packages. However, we understand that in certain situations, an editor
may need to step down before the 1 year time period has ended.</p>
<p>We also understand that life gets busy. You are always welcome to “say no”
to a review during a busy time.</p>
<p>We welcome
editors staying on for longer as long as they are happy serving with us and
they get along well with other members of the editorial board, the software

<h3>✔️ 3. Identify reviewers for the Python package<a class="headerlink" href="#identify-reviewers-for-the-python-package" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Each review should have at least two reviewers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One reviewer should have expertise in both Python and the scientific domain related to the package submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>The second reviewer can be more generally focused on the package’s usability, accessibility, and packaging infrastructure. This allows people who are newer to review to get involved while also providing a critical usability check for the package.</p></li>

<h4>Finding package reviewers<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-package-reviewers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>

<p>If you can, try to find two people to serve as reviewers within <strong>two weeks
of responding to the issue as the editor</strong>. If it takes longer, as
often does, make a point to keep the author posted on the issue
as you continue your search. You may add language such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Hey, &#64;authorGithubHandle I just wanted to drop in to let you know that I’m searching for reviewers for your package. It may take a bit more time.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This type of communication just lets the author know that the process is
moving forward. Even if it takes longer to find reviews, authors generally
appreciate the communication and understand it’s a volunteer-led process.</p>

<div class="highlight-markdown notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Dear [REVIEWER-Name],

Hi, this is [EDITOR-Name]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I&#39;m writing to ask if you have time
to review a package for pyOpenSci. pyOpenSci has an open peer review of open source Python packages that support science. Accepted packages become a part of our pyOpenSci ecosystem of vetted community-adopted tools. Our review process is similar to that
of open journals however it focuses on ensuring high quality packaging approaches
that are inline with community adopted Python standards.

The package, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [ONBOARDING ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks (We’ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.).

Our [<span class="nt">reviewers guide</span>](<span class="na">https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/reviewer-guide.html</span>) details what we look for in a package review, and includes links to example reviews.
We also include a reviewer template on that page that you can use to guide your review. Our Python packaging standards are detailed in our [<span class="nt">packaging guide</span>](<span class="na">https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide</span>).

If you have time, please have a look at the package first, to make
sure that you do not have a conflict of interest with the package authors.

If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me.

{IF APPLICABLE: The authors have also chosen to jointly submit their package to the Journal of Open Source Software, so this package includes a short <span class="sb">`paper.md`</span> manuscript describing the software that we ask you include in your review.}

Are you able to review? If you can not, I welcome any suggestions that you
have for other reviewers. If I don&#39;t hear from you within a week, I will assume
that you are unable to review this package at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]

<p>If the package fits within the JOSS Scope, once the package has been approved
by pyOpenSci:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tag the issue <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">7/under-joss-review</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruct the author to <a href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#what-should-my-paper-contain" target="_blank">read the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paper.md</span></code> file requirements</a> for JOSS and ensure that paper is added to the repo.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct the package author to <a class="reference external" href="https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html">follow the instructions to submit the package to JOSS</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These instructions loosely include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Login to the JOSS website and fill out the JOSS submission form. When you fill out the form, be sure to mention and link to the approved pyOpenSci review.</p></li>

<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>The scope of packages accepted by pyOpenSci is sometimes different from those
accepted by JOSS. Not all pyOpenSci accepted packages will be accepted by JOSS.
Further, packages that have been previously published elsewhere may not be
eligible to be published with JOSS unless <strong>significant</strong> changes and improvements
to package functionality have been made.</p>
</div>
<p>JOSS will accept the pyOpenSci review and direct the author to check their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paper.md</span></code> file. Once JOSS accepts the package,
the author will be instructed to add the JOSS DOI badge to their package <strong>README</strong> file.</p>
<p>Once the package is accepted by JOSS and the DOI badge resolves properly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tag the issue with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">9/joss-approved</span></code>. (Please do NOT remove the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyos-approved</span></code> label, instead add the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JOSS-approved</span></code> label)</p></li>

<p>Once the review is complete, you can close the issue. Before doing that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be sure that the issue is correctly tagged with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6/pyOS-approved</span></code> (and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">9/joss-approved</span></code> if authors decided to submit to JOSS and were accepted).</p></li>
<li><p>Check the pyOpenSci website to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The package was added to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages/">pyOpenSci website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewers and maintainers are listed on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pyopensci.org/our-community/">contributors page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the YAML at the top of the issue is filled out and up to date.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If JOSS approves the package, be sure that the issue is tagged with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">7/JOSS-approved</span></code> and that the archive / DOI information at the top is updated with the JOSS archive before closing the issue.</p></li>
